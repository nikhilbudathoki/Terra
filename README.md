# Terra
Terra is a high performance 2D game engine built in C++ and SDL with integrated support for Lua scripting. I worked on the project to learn and polish my C++ skills and to better understand the workings of game development.

## Features
Here is a list of the features currently supposed by Terra:
- [x] Dynamic Camera movement
- [x] Keyboard input handling 
- [x] File loading
- [x] BMP sprite assets 
- [x] Custom animations
- [x] Projectile mechanics
- [x] Collision physics
- [x] Text Rendering 
- [x] UI elements(Radars, HUDs) 
- [x] Lua script support
- [x] Custom map editor


## Next Steps
More prototypes developed in the engine will be pushed to the repository soon. 

Also, I will be adding detailed instrutions on how to write your own Lua scripts specifying game parameters to pass in to the engine. 

## Try it out
You will need to clone the repository to try it out. 
Run the makefile with `make build` to compile the project. 
Execute the compiled `game.exe` executable directly or with `make run` to see a prototype of a top-down tank shooting game prototype created in the engine.
