# Terra
Terra is a high performance 2D game engine built in C++ and SDL with integrated support for Lua scripting. Here is a list of the features currently supposed by Terra:
- Dynamic Camera movement
- Lua script support
- Input handling 
- File loading
- Sprites and animations
- BMP Sprite sheet assets 
- Projectile movements
- Collision physics
- Custom map editor
- Graphics and Text rendering and UI elements 

## Try it out
You will need to clone the repository to try it out. 
Then, run the makefile with `make build` followed by `make run` to see a prototype of a top-down tank shooting game prototype created in the engine.



## Next Steps
More prototypes developed in the engine will be pushed to the repository soon. 

Also, I will be adding detailed instrutions on how to write your own Lua scripts specifying game parameters to pass in to the engine.
